Questions:

(For the explanations, generally a sentence or two should be enough.)

1.  Could BFS solve Wolf-Goat-Cabbage, using NullDict?

2.  What happened when you tried to use DFS to solve Wolf-Goat-Cabbage
using NullDict?  Briefly explain why this happened.

3.  Which of BFS, DFS, and BestFS (using the TodoList implementations
I provided) correctly solve Wolf-Goat-Cabbage, using LinkedListDict?

4.  Could BFS solve Sudoku?  What happened?  Briefly explain why.

5.  Could DFS solve Sudoku?  What happened?  Briefly explain why.

6.  Could BestFS solve Sudoku?

7.  Using LinkedListDict, try using BFS and DFS to solve the 3x3
Slider Puzzle.  What happened?  Briefly explain why.

8.  Using LinkedListDict, try using BestFS to solve the 3x3
Slider Puzzle.  How long did this take?

9.  Using LinkedListDict, use BestFS to solve the 3x4 and 4x4
Slider Puzzles I provided.  How long did these take?  Which
computer did you use?

We will also be checking whether you have correctly implemented
the ArrayQueue and LinkedListStack classes.
